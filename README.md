rSPACE
====

rSPACE provides a framework for analyzing the power of monitoring designs to detect trends in population abundance  in ecological settings. A simple, spatially-explicit population simulation is used to create sample datasets with which to assess the power of sampling and an analysis method.

We are currently working to test and develop the code to be more generally accessible.  If you have questions concerning how to implement rSPACE or if there are features that you would like to see added (or if you have any other feedback on the current implementation), please contact us via [ISSUES](https://github.com/mmellis/rSPACE/issues).  

To install:

1. Make sure you have [Program MARK](http://www.phidot.org/software/mark/downloads/) and the most current version of [R](http://cran.us.r-project.org/) (or at least 3.1.2)

2. Install released verison: `install.packages("rSPACE")`

3. load rSPACE library in R: `library(rSPACE)`

4. Find the handy package overview `help(rSPACE, package="rSPACE")`
